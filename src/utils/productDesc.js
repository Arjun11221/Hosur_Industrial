    description: "Copper cathode is a form of copper that has a purity of 99.95%. In order to remove impurities from copper ore, it undergoes two processes, smelting and electrorefining. The resulting, nearly pure copper is an excellent conductor and is often used in electrical wiring.Copper cathode is a main industrial product with high purity rate. It is used in producing copper wire, copper plates and various alloys, including mainly brass-bronze alloys. Contact us for more details, specification and Analysis.",
